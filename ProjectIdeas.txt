Ideas
1. LLM generated medical advice VS Human advice/Human+LLM
    Create medical scenarios, collect advice from people with and without LLM help, score the answers using medical guidelines, 
and compare the results statistically.

2. Study name effects in LLM-based internship resume screening
    Create identical internship resumes with different applicant names, have an LLM screen using a fixed prompt, 
and compare outcomes across name types.
